# Walmart Sales - EDA and regression
This is my one of my first data science projects and it was made with python. The dataset came from a Kaggle competition and contains 3 files, sales by Store and Dept, some characteristics of stores and features for all the dates. Task consist on creating a model to make future sales predictions for each dept on each store.
